# INSERTION SORT PROJECT

<br />

## Write the stages of the sequence according to the sorting type : 

      1 - [2, 27, 16, 22, 18, 6]
      
      2 - [2, 6, 16, 22, 18, 27]
      
      3 - [2, 6, 16, 18, 22, 27]
      
      
## Type the Big-O notation : 

      O(n)
      
      
## Time Complexity : 

      Average case : O(n)
  
      Worst case   : O(n^2)
  
      Best case    : O (n)
      
      
## What case does the number 18 fall into after the array is sorted? :

      Worst Case
